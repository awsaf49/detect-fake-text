This process starts with tokenization, where input strings are converted into sequences of token IDs.\n","\n","**Why it's important:** Initially, raw text data is complex and challenging for modeling due to its high dimensionality. By converting text into a compact set of tokens, such as transforming `\"The quick brown fox\"` into `[\"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\"]`, we simplify the data. Many models rely on special tokens and additional tensors to understand input. These tokens help divide input and identify padding, among other tasks. Making all sequences the same length through padding boosts computational efficiency, making subsequent steps smoother.\n","\n","Explore the following pages to access the available preprocessing and tokenizer layers in **KerasNLP**:\n","- [Preprocessing](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/preprocessing_layers/)\n","- [Tokenizers](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/tokenizers/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"id":"f44f61a3","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-17T08:56:35.073776Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-17T08:56:35.073441Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-17T08:56:35.809375Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-17T08:56:35.808419Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.750082,"end_time":"2023-11-17T08:56:35.811755","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-11-17T08:56:35.061673","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["vocab_path = '/kaggle/input/keras-nlp-deberta-v3-base-en-vocab-ds/vocab.spm'\n","tokenizer= keras_nlp.models.DebertaV3Tokenizer(vocab_path)\n","preprocessor= keras_nlp.models.DebertaV3Preprocessor(tokenizer, sequence_length=CFG.sequence_length)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a770fbbb","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.010604,"end_time":"2023-11-17T08:56:35.83339","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-11-17T08:56:35.822786","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Now, let's examine what the output shape of the preprocessing layer looks like.
